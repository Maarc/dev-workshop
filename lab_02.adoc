= Lab 2 - Introspection, Monitoring, and Metrics using Spring Boot Actuator

_A completed version of this lab is found at `$COURSE_HOME/labs/complete/hello-spring-boot`._

== Set up the Actuator

. Continue with the project you completed in link:lab_01.html[Lab 1].

. To `pom.xml` add the following dependency to include the starter for Spring Boot Actuator:
+
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. To the main YAML document in `application.yml` add the following:
+
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
----
+
"*" can be used to select all endpoints. For example, to expose everything over HTTP.

== Introspection Endpoints

. Build the application:
+
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/hello-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Try out the following endpoints. The output is omitted here because it can be quite large:
+
http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans:: Dumps all of the beans in the Spring context.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/autoconfig:: Dumps all of the auto-configuration performed as part of application bootstrapping.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/configprops:: Displays a collated list of all `@ConfigurationProperties`.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/env:: Dumps the application's shell environment as well as all Java system properties.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings:: Dumps all URI request mappings and the controller methods to which they are mapped.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/dump:: Performs a thread dump.
http://localhost:8080/actuator/trace:: Displays trace information (by default the last few HTTP requests).

. Stop the application (e.g. via CTRL-C).

== Build and Version Control Info

Spring Boot provides an endpoint (http://localhost:8080/info) that allows the exposure of arbitrary metadata.

One thing that it does well is expose information about the specific build and version control coordinates for a given deployment.

. Add the following plugin to your Maven build.
It will add Git branch and commit coordinates to the `/info` endpoint:
+
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>pl.project13.maven</groupId>
	<artifactId>git-commit-id-plugin</artifactId>
	<configuration>
		<dotGitDirectory>../../../.git</dotGitDirectory>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
NOTE: The path `../../../.git` refers to the `.git` directory at the root of the course materials.

. Add the following properties to `src/main/resources/application.yml`:
+
----
info:
  build:
    artifact: @project.artifactId@
    name: @project.name@
    description: @project.description@
    version: @project.version@
----
+
These properties should be added to the topmost YAML document, above the `---`. They will add the project's Maven coordinates to the `/info` endpoint. The Spring Boot Maven plugin will cause them to automatically be replaced in the assembled JAR.

. Build the application:
+
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/hello-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Visit the application in the browser (http://localhost:8080/info), and verify that the output is similar to the following:
+
----
{
   "git" : {
      "commit" : {
         "time" : "2015-12-06T17:25:32-0500",
         "id" : "78b0e1b"
      },
      "branch" : "master"
   },
   "build" : {
      "version" : "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT",
      "name" : "hello-spring-boot",
      "artifact" : "hello-spring-boot",
      "description" : "Demo project for Spring Boot"
   }
}
----

. Stop the application (e.g. via CTRL-C).

== Health Indicators

Spring Boot provides an endpoint (http://localhost:8080/health) that allows for the notion of various health indicators.

. Create the class `io.pivotal.spring.hellospringboot.FlappingHealthIndicator` and into it paste the following code:
+
----
@Component
public class FlappingHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator{

    private Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        int result = random.nextInt(100);
        if (result < 50) {
            return Health.down().withDetail("flapper", "failure").withDetail("random", result).build();
        } else {
            return Health.up().withDetail("flapper", "ok").withDetail("random", result).build();
        }
    }
}
----
+
This demo health indicator will randomize the health check.

. Build the application:
+
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/hello-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Visit the application in the browser (http://localhost:8080/health), and verify that the output is similar to the following (and changes randomly!):
+
----
{
  status: "UP",
  flapping: {
    status: "UP",
    flapper: "ok",
    random: 69
  },
  diskSpace: {
    status: "UP",
    free: 113632186368,
    threshold: 10485760
  }
}
----

. Stop the application (e.g. via CTRL-C).

== Metrics

Spring Boot provides an endpoint (http://localhost:8080/metrics) that exposes several automatically collected metrics for your application.
It also allows for the creation of custom metrics.

. Create the class `io.pivotal.spring.hellospringboot.GreetingService` and into it paste the following code:
+
----
@Component
public class GreetingService {

    @Autowired
    CounterService counterService;

    @Value("${greeting}")
    String greeting;

    public String getGreeting() {
        counterService.increment("counter.services.greeting.invoked");
        return greeting;
    }
}
----
+
This class is using the `@Autowired` `CounterService` to count the number of times that the `getGreeting()` method has been invoked.

. Refactor the contents of the class `io.pivotal.spring.hellospringboot.HelloSpringBootApplication`:
+
----
@Autowired
private GreetingService greetingService;

@RequestMapping("/")
public String hello() {
    return String.format("%s World!", greetingService.getGreeting());
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(HelloSpringBootApplication.class, args);
}
----
+
`hello()` is now delegating the source of the greeting to our newly created `GreetingService`.

. Build the application:
+
----
$ ./mvnw package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/hello-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Visit the application in the browser (http://localhost:8080) and refresh the page several times.

. Now visit the `/metrics` endpoint (http://localhost:8080/metrics).
Among the autogenerated metrics you should see a `counter` for the `GreetingService` invocations:
+
----
counter.services.greeting.invoked: 16,
----

. Stop the application (e.g. via CTRL-C).
