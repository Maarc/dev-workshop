# dev-workshop

The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent engaging with the technology directly!

NOTE: We will be updating the course materials throughout the class. You will need to have the materials cloned.

This can be accomplished as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dflick-pivotal/dev-workshop
```
